## Introduction

When you run "apt list --upgradable" in your terminal, you find around 2000 upgradable packages (if you are using parrot os or kali linux like distibution). It hard to find your important package or security releases.  

For this solution, here is "sachet".

## Compatability
Python 3.6+ is required.

## Installation

```bash
pip install sachet
```
or 

```bash
pip3 install sachet
```

## Then run it with:

```bash

```
